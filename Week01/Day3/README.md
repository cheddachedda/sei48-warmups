## Warmup - Raindrops

Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:

- If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5 or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.

### Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".
